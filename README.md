# What we need...
1. A covid tracker that is light-weight, and displays the cases for the day on iOS widgets and watch complications.
2. Behaves like a native app, like world clock, stock, with quick searching feature.
3. Prototype now with lookup by county only. Then, we build other capabilities if needed.


#  TODO

## Widget is now being force quit on real-device for using too much memory. I think this is related to using DataFrame to parse the CSV file. Would be great to have a backend that returns information only for the specific county.
