# What we need...
1. A covid tracker that is light-weight, and displays the cases for the day on iOS widgets and watch complications.
2. Behaves like a native app, like world clock, stock, with quick searching feature.
3. Prototype now with lookup by county only. Then, we build other capabilities if needed.


#  TODO

## Figure out how to "refresh" our widgit. We should have an optional parameter that controls how often the widget is updated. We could do 1 hour for real app, but 1 min for testing. And we should add a "updated how many minutes ago" text to see when its being updated when testing.

## Return placeholder and actual views in Widget Extension. (This should be quick)

## Ability to configure/search available counties in the Widget settings. (Probably have to use Intention APIs?)
